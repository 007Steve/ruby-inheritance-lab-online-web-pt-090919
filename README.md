Feel free to choose a domain, but one that seems to work well is the User, instructor, teacher. All users have first_name, last_name. Instructors have a method called teach that returns a knowledge string. Students have a knowledge array, they have a method called learn that takes in a string and adds it to their knowledge array. Users can login/logout, just save their state to a boolean called is_logged or something. Have them create a separate file that isn't in a class, just creates a user, instructor and student and does some operations on that. The User can be someone like a spectator. like "Hey jim wants to come and audit the class, he needs an account but he's not a user or instructor let's just make him a user"
